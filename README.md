# LIVEy
Communication tool for LIVE broadcasts

In Live TV- or radio broadcast I often run into the problem, that I can not talk to my presenter or to one of my guests. Sometimes because of technical limitations, sometimes because the presenter is still talking. 
Some time I heard an episode of [Tim Pritlove's](http://metaebene.me/) podcast [Freakshow](http://freakshow.fm/). He talked about his wish to have a tool, providing similar features. That's why I started coding... 

Maybe LIVEy does what he needed, maybe not. But for me it is the first step to a useful tool for my work.
